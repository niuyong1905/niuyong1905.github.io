Participants discussed quantum gases, quantum fluids, quantum solids, and related macroscopic quantum phenomena; superconductivity, strongly correlated electron systems, and quantum phase transitions; the magnetism of solids and their surfaces/interfaces, spintronics, the properties of multiferroic materials, and thermal properties; the properties of low-dimensional materials and nanodevices, topological insulators/Dirac semimetals, quantum transport, quantum computing, low-temperature experimental techniques, and applications, demonstrating the broad application prospects of low-temperature physics research.
