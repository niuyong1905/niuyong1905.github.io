abstract: We accomplish a laboratory facility for producing a femtosecond XUV coherent monochromatic source with a broad tunable spectral range of 20~75 eV. It is based on spectrally selection of multiple harmonic orders from high harmonic generation in intense laser field. By designing a Czerny–Turner type monochromator with the conical diffraction grating mount, a time preserving for the selected harmonic radiation is achieved, minimizing the time broadening caused by grating diffraction and keeping a relatively high diffraction efficiency. The photon flux of the 23 order harmonic (H23) centered at 35.7 eV is 1×10^9  photons/s approximately with a resolving power about 36. This light source provides an ultrashort tunable monochromatic XUV beam that could be attractive for ultrafast electronic and structural dynamics in a large variety of systems.
