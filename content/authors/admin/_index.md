Yong Niu is a associate professor of Atomic and Molecular Physics in School of Physics & Information Science, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology. His research interests include attosecond physics, first-principles calculations and Physics-Informed Machine Learning. He leads the Attosecond and Computational Science Group (ACSG), which develops coherent XUV/soft-X-ray sources based on the high-harmonic generation process with femtosecond/attosecond time and nanometer spatial resolution for spectroscopy, imaging, and metrology applications, particularly for probing the properties of quantum materials.
