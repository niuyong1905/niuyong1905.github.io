summary: He explained the contributions of the three scientists who won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics in generating attosecond light pulses and using these ultrashort pulses to probe ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules, liquids, and materials.
abstract: 'During the seminar, Professor Si-Zuo Luo, drawing on his experience working in the research group of Nobel laureate Anne L'Huillier, introduced the working principles and experimental characterization methods of using high-harmonic generation to produce attosecond extreme ultraviolet light pulses. He explained the contributions of the three scientists who won the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics in generating attosecond light pulses and using these ultrashort pulses to probe ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules, liquids, and materials. He also shared the work methods, modes of operation, and interesting stories of the Nobel Prize research group, which are rarely known. Finally, he highlighted the progress made by the Atomic and Molecular Physics Research Institute of Jilin University in developing attosecond extreme ultraviolet light sources over the past few years.'
